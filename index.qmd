## Wise words from Ada Lovelace {.smaller}

::: {layout-ncol=2}

> It is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that might arise as to the powers of the Analytical Engine. In considering any new subject, there is frequently a tendency, first, to *overrate* what we find to be already interesting or remarkable; and, secondly, by a sort of natural reaction, to *undervalue* the true state of the case, when we do discover that our notions have surpassed those that were really tenable.

## LLMs are the best RA you've ever had

- Dramatically faster
- Dramatically cheaper
- 80th percentile (my opinion) in general aptitude 
- 99th percentile (my opinion) in coding

**If you're not using LLMs on a daily basis, you're missing out.**

## Which LLMs to use?

I subscribe to all three "frontier" models:

- I use [Claude](https://claude.ai) and [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) daily; occasionally [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)
- Claude is my favorite, esp. for coding / language tasks
- ChatGPT has more bells and whistles
  - Generate images
  - `o1` for "deep thinking" (useful for math) 
  - search the web
- Gemini has never given me good results but I keep trying

## Reverse-compile a LaTeX Document

- This tutorial sheet is full of typos; but I don't have the TeX! 
- Two options
  1. Copy-and-paste the text of the .pdf into an LLM or
  2. Upload the .pdf itself 
- Provide a prompt like this:

> Here is text that I've copied and pasted from a .pdf document generated using LaTeX. Please give me the underlying TeX code needed to generate it. 

## Create `.tex` from Handwritten Notes

## Make clipart for your slides

<!--two column layout with images side-by-side, adjusting width of each to fit-->

## Get Help Writing Grants

- Upload your notes on a project / grant ideas
- Upload the grant requirements from the website
- Ask for help fitting your content into the required boxes
  - E.g. "narrative CV" for UKRI 
- Re-write in your own words; then ask for writing feedback
- **Trust me: this actually works**

## An Improved Rubber Duckie

- LLMs can't (yet) fully explain an Econometrica paper to you
- But they can help you explain it to yourself!
- Upload the paper; ask for a summary
- Then start a conversation with the LLM. 
- When it gets something wrong, try explaining why it's wrong.
- Continue the conversation

## But wait: there's more! {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- **Get help making a TikZ figure**
    - Start with sketch and ask for draft
    - Compile result, paste screenshot
    - Ask for changes; repeat
- **Practice giving an Oxford interview**
    - Ask the LLM to role-play an applicant 
- **Create new teaching examples**
    - Upload past examples; ask for ideas
- **Write tweets to promote your research**
    - Within character limit; "idiomatic"
- **Get help with email tone / boundaries**
    - Draft email; ask for feedback
    - Great for difficult student emails
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
- **Check your algebra / help with math**
    - Upload TeX or image
    - `o1` is best; Claude is also good
- **Get legal advice** (seriously)
    - Describe the legal issue at hand
    - ChatGPT can point to relevant statutes
    - Then go read the statutes yourself
- **Get feedback on teaching materials**
    - Upload slides / notes / draft exams
    - Ask if anything is confusing  
- **Learn a Language**
    - Practice writing; ask for corrections
    - Practice conversation (ChatGPT)

## LLMs as Complements to Other Tools 

- LLMs lower cost of learning *other* productivity tools
- Great at teaching and debugging coding / tech tools 
- Ask for help; try things; paste in the error messages; repeat
- Low-hanging fruit: 

  1. Learn how to touch type and use a good editor! 
  2. Version control with git / github
  3. The LaTeX exam class
  4. Quarto / Markdown

## Is your workflow stuck in the 1990s?

- `paper_restud_final_v23_withedits_revised.tex`
- "Why have all the numbers in table 2 changed?"
- "I can't find the version we submitted to Econometrica!"
- "I'm working in Dropbox now: stay out of the paper folder!"
- "Oops: I gave the wrong exam to the MPhil students!"

## Version Control: git / github

- Keep past versions of your work without the clutter 
- Collaborate with others without the chaos
- Track changes to your work over time
- Share your code / results with the world
- Let's Git started! 
  - [Happy Git and Github](https://happygitwithr.com/)

## The LaTeX Exam Class

I thought every one already used this; but apparently not...

## Quarto / Markdown

- This document was made using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)
- Weave together content \& code into a finished document
- Many output formats: slides, papers, websites, books, etc.
- Even Microsoft Word / Powerpoint! 
  - <crosses self, sprays holy water>
- Simple syntax, easy to learn: based on [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

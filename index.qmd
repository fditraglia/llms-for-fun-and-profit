## While I have your attention...

- LLMs are a *complement* to other tools
- They lower the cost of learning new things
- Low-hanging fruit: 

  1. Learn how to touch type fast!
  2. Version control with git / github
  3. The LaTeX exam class
  4. Quarto / Markdown

## Is your workflow stuck in the 1990s?

- `paper_restud_final_v23_withedits_revised.tex`
- "Why have all the numbers in table 2 changed?"
- "I can't find the version we submitted to Econometrica!"
- "I'm working in Dropbox now: stay out of the paper folder!"
- "Oops: I gave the wrong exam to the MPhil students!"

## Version Control: git / github

- Keep past versions of your work without the clutter 
- Collaborate with others without the chaos
- Track changes to your work over time
- Share your code / results with the world
- Let's Git started! 
  - [Happy Git and Github](https://happygitwithr.com/)

## The LaTeX Exam Class

I thought every one already used this; but apparently not...

## Quarto / Markdown

- This document was made using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)
- Weave together content \& code into a finished document
- Many output formats: slides, papers, websites, books, etc.
- Even Microsoft Word / Powerpoint! 
  - <crosses self, sprays holy water>
- Simple syntax, easy to learn: based on [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
